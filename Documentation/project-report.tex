\section{Introduction}
Motivation, Novelty, How your paper is tackling it and what it does well\\
\\
Music composition involves innovation, creativity and sense of melody. Through this project, we hope to discover how music can be composed without the involvement of musicians. Taking motivation from the paper we presented for our first presentation, we will try to utilize our knowledge of evolutionary algorithms to compose melodies.


\section{Technical Background}
Explain techniques used in the project\\\\
Evolutionary Algorithms as inspired by the process of biological evolution are beneficial for optimization. Using concepts of reproduction, mutation, selection and recombination on candidate solutions (chromosomes), evolutionary algorithms (also called genetic algorithms) solve an optimization problem. Fitness function determines how good the candidate solution is and works by evolving the solutions to obtain the optimum solution to the problem.

\section{Methodology}
Our approach is to utilize the learning from this course regarding "Evolutionary Algorithms" to compose music. The chromosome for composing music is a melody itself which is represented as a list of 4-tuples defining a single note. For example, $(0, 4, 32, 4)$ where each index of a note represents an attribute as, \\
Index 0:\\
Index 1:\\
Index 2:\\
Index 3:\\\\

\begin{center}
    [(0, 4, 32, 4), (6, 0, 6, 4), (4, 2, 20, 4), (6, 1, 14, 4),\\ (2, 1, 10, 4), (3, 1, 11, 4), (1, 3, 25, 4), (3, 4, 35, 4),\\ (5, 0, 5, 4), (0, 2, 16, 4), (7, 3, 31, 4), (2, 5, 42, 4),\\ (5, 3, 29, 4), (0, 2, 16, 4), (1, 5, 41, 4), (6, 0, 6, 4),\\ (7, 3, 31, 4), (7, 5, 47, 4), (5, 0, 5, 4), (0, 3, 24, 4),\\ (2, 3, 26, 4), (0, 5, 40, 4), (2, 5, 42, 4), (0, 1, 8, 4),\\ (3, 5, 43, 4), (4, 4, 36, 4), (5, 3, 29, 4), (5, 5, 45, 4),\\ (1, 1, 9, 4), (7, 3, 31, 4), (7, 4, 39, 4), (1, 1, 9, 4)]\\

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' . Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' . 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation .
